## ABOUT

This is the Github page for the HippiesBattlegrounds codebase, used on the Battlegrounds server. This codebase is built off the work of many different servers, primarily that of Ava's Battlegrounds, Baystation12 and No Man's Land.
Because of this, the repository inherits the previous licensing of those repositories, among other things.
If you would like to contribute to this codebase, first take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
