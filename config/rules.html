<p>Rules</p>

<p><b>OOC - To be dealt with primarily by OOC punishments.</b></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Be a good sport. No matter how salty you get, remember the bullets aren't real. The players are.</p></li>

<li><p>No IC in OOC. Do not communicate or coordinate outside of the game client. Dead men do not talk.</p></li>

<li><p>Do not multikey. If two players need to connect from a shared IP, inform the administration and remember to obey Rule 2. </p></li>

<li><p>Do not powergame / metagame. Exploits, glitches and overpowered elements should be discovered, reported to staff, and set aside by players.</p></li>

<li><p>Use adminhelp sparingly. We are often flooded with questions that can be answered by IC or LOOC channels.</p></li>

<li><p>Grief will be met with a perma ban, with slim chance of appeal.</p></li>

<p><b>OOC - Roleplaying: To be dealt with primarily by OOC punishments.</b></p>

<li><p>This is a ROLEPLAYING SERVER. If you can roleplay, roleplay. If you won't roleplay, or start ruining the roleplaying enviroment for others, there are other SS13 servers for you.</p></li>

<li><p>You are roleplaying a human being. Scream, beg, curse, cry, find resolve and fall apart. Do not be an emotionless blank.</p></li>

<li><p>You are roleplaying a soldier on the Eastern Front of WWII, in regular units of the Heer, SS, or Red Army. Not a snowflake, or the one guy in a picture you googled. Please set your gender, hair, age, and skin tone accordingly.</p></li>

<li><p>Your character is in a faction with strict discipline engaged in total war. If disobedience and insubordination manages to cross your in-character mind, expect a beating, firing-squad or nonchalant pistol to the head. </p></li>

<li><p>If you decide to play in leadership or whitelisted roles, you are accepting the challenge of higher standard of roleplay. Be a shining beacon of the Soviet/National Socialist ideal. Or a butcher. But be something deserving of the privilege, or a job ban may follow.</p></li>

<li><p>Do not powergame. Limit yourself to the role you are assigned, and leave complicated tasks to other roles.
X. ERP is strictly forbidden. Enjoy your permaban.

<p>Heer:</p>

<p>“Then there was the war, and I married it because there was nothing else when I reached the age of falling in love.” 
? Guy Sajer, The Forgotten Soldier</p>

<ol>
<li>All soldiers must have a regulation haircut (short hair of some variety) and no beard. A close-cut mustache is acceptable. Hair dye is unacceptable.</li>

<li>Soldiers of backgrounds other than good European stock will erode unit discipline. Such soldiers are to be turned over to the base prison, to be returned to our various ethnicly pure units.</li>

<li>At this time, all soldiers must be male. The war is not yet so terrible, mein kameraden. Women found in uniform are to be turned over to the base prison, to be returned to the Fatherland.</li>

<li>Arms and ammunition are to be drawn from the armory under the supervision or by the rationing of the Stabsgefreiter. Breaking into the armory constitutes theft of Heer property and will be punished, outside of a crisis. Trophy weapons are acceptable, but hoarding weapons is not. </li>

<li>Obey the orders of your Gruppenfuhrer, who shall receive his orders from the Feldwebel. In absence of leadership, march to the sound of the guns.</li>

<li>You are obliged to take surrendering adversaries prisoner, as we are not savages. Prisoners of war are to be stripped to their uniform and boots, then interred in the base prison under guard.</li>

<li>Feldwebel; you may order an execution by firing squad of a Heer soldier for looting, sleeping on sentry duty, hoarding war supplies, hoarding rations, refusing a direct order in the face of the enemy, desertion, escaping prison or against spies caught in German uniform. You may also defer to lesser punishment such as beatings or imprisonment.
S.S.:</li>
</ol>

<p>"I did not volunteer for the Waffen SS, but was, as were thousands of my year group, conscripted. I did not then know as a 17-year-old that it was a criminal unit. I thought it was an elite unit." 
? Gunter Grass</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Obey all standard regulations of the Heer, except where national socialist policy is furthered by ignoring such regulations.</p></li>

<li><p>Enforce standards of ethnic purity, good discipline and order among the Heer. Protect officers and, should neccessity arise, the sanctity of German womanhood. Use the prison, and if need be, execution to maintain the pure sword of Germania.</p></li>

<li><p>Maintain order within the prison and among prisoners. It is not nessicary to concern yourself with the ethnic purity of the prisoners. That's another department...</p></li>

<li><p>Execution of your fellow German soldiers is acceptable only when the example of one corrects the error of many, or when a specific crime warrants it. Perform such executions formally whenever possible to maximize the corrective effect on the others, and with notification to the Feldwebel.</p></li>

<li><p>Arms and ammunition are to be drawn from the S.S. railcars first, and requested from the Heer armory as a secondary measure.</p></li>

<li><p>Obey the orders of the Unterscharfuhrer, and support Heer operations in the area. You are in parallel chains of command.</p></li>

<li><p>Unterscharfuhrer, you may order an execution by firing squad of an SS soldier for any reason the Feldwebel might, plus any reason that furthers national socialism. But try to be reasonable, the Heer and the Reds both outnumber us...
Red Army:</p>

<p>“Are there any extenuating causes for withdrawing from a firing position?” soldiers would ask their politruks. In future, the reply that handbooks prescribed would be “The only extenuating cause is death.” 
? Catherine Merridale, Ivan’s War: Life and Death in the Red Army</p></li>

<li><p>All soldiers must have a regulation haircut (short hair of some variety). Groomed beards and mustaches are acceptable. Hair dye is unacceptable.</p></li>

<li><p>Soldiers of backgrounds other than good Soviet stock will erode unit discipline. Such soldiers are to be given menial or unpleasant tasks or returned to our various ethnicly pure units.</p></li>

<li><p>The Motherland calls all her sons and daughters to the defense. While the battlefield is still no place for a woman and all officers must be male, women are given duties as Sanitars, occasionally show up as Soldats or in special roles as Snaipers or Zavhozs. </p></li>

<li><p>You are not obligated to spare the lives of German cowards, except where they might yield valuable information. Mercy to the fascists is a political crime.</p></li>

<li><p>Arms and ammunition are to be drawn from the armory under the supervision or by the rationing of the Zavhoz. Breaking into the armory constitutes theft of State property and will be punished, outside of a crisis. Trophy weapons are acceptable, but hoarding weapons is not. </p></li>

<li><p>Obey the orders of your Sergant, who shall receive his orders from the Comandiry Batalyona. In absence of orders, you may not retreat.</p></li>

<li><p>Comandiry Batalyona; you may order an execution by firing squad for looting, sleeping on sentry duty, hoarding war supplies, hoarding rations, refusing a direct order in the face of the enemy, desertion, insubordination, retreat without orders, failure to execute an order, failure to complete an order, griping, self-mutilation, feigned illness, cowardice, political crimes, or against spies caught in Soviet uniform. You may also defer to lesser punishment such as ordering them to mineclearing or wirecutting details so that their blood may wash out their crimes against the Motherland.</p></li>
